With a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, I pursued a career in actuarial science and data analysis, where I honed my ability to analyze complex datasets and derive meaningful insights. While building data pipelines and automating processes, I discovered a passion for software development and decided to make a career transition to pursue this newfound interest.

During my time at App Academy, I underwent an intensive, immersive training program that covered full-stack web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React, and SQL. The program's rigorous curriculum emphasized not only technical skills but also collaboration, problem-solving, and project management, all of which are essential in a software development role. 

Now, I'm so excited to call myself a software engineer. Some of my favorite tools and languages include React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, SQL, and Python. I'm currently looking for a job where I can make an impact, continue learning and refining my skills, and work alongside passionate and motivated people.
